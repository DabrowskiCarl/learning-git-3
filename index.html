                <p>[Verse 1: Macklemore]
                        I wanna be sober, but I love gettin' high
                        Wanna give it a hundred percent, but I'm too afraid to try
                        I wanna be faithful, but love hookin' up with randos
                        I wanna live by the law, but still think like a vandal
                        I wanna get exercise, but I'm too lazy to workout
                        I want all the finer things, but don't wanna go to work now
                        I wanna go outside, take my family to the beach
                        I wake up in the morning, first thing I do is look at a screen, at a screen</p>
                <p>[Pre-Chorus: Macklemore]
                        Wanna live freely, why isn't it so easy?
                        I should read a book, but I keep watchin' this TV
                        And I know this lifestyle doesn't really feed me
                        I just tune out to the voice inside that's speaking</p>
		    <p>[Chorus: Dan Caplen]
All my little problems keep on buildin' up, and buildin' up
All my good intentions just ain't good enough, can't find the love
So I smoke until my lungs are full
And drink until I lose my cool
Apology's my middle name, and one day I will change, but
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am today</p>
		    <p>[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I want world peace, but I wanna watch Worldstar
I know that I should stay home, and still wanna kick it where the girls are
I wanna be a feminist, but I'm still watchin' porno
I wanna eat healthy, but I'ma eat this DiGiornos
We live on social media, read other people's thoughts
Tweet about justice, but don't show up to the march
I think about the earth, and I think about the eco
What am I willin' to sacrifice at the expense of my ego?</p>
