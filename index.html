                <p>[Verse 1: Macklemore]
                        I wanna be sober, but I love gettin' high
                        Wanna give it a hundred percent, but I'm too afraid to try
                        I wanna be faithful, but love hookin' up with randos
                        I wanna live by the law, but still think like a vandal
                        I wanna get exercise, but I'm too lazy to workout
                        I want all the finer things, but don't wanna go to work now
                        I wanna go outside, take my family to the beach
                        I wake up in the morning, first thing I do is look at a screen, at a screen</p>
                <p>[Pre-Chorus: Macklemore]
                        Wanna live freely, why isn't it so easy?
                        I should read a book, but I keep watchin' this TV
                        And I know this lifestyle doesn't really feed me
                        I just tune out to the voice inside that's speaking</p>
